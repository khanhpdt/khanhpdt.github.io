# Checklist when writing code

- Single responsibility:

 “Gather together those things that change for the same reason, and separate those things that change for different reasons.”, Robert C. Martin
 
- Tell, don't ask

 "Rather than asking an object for data and acting on that data, we should instead tell an object what to do.", Martin Fowler.
