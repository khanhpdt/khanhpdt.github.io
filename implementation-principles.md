# Principles when writing code

- Single responsibility

 “Gather together those things that change for the same reason, and separate those things that change for different reasons.”, https://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2014/05/08/SingleReponsibilityPrinciple.html
 
- Tell, don't ask

 "Rather than asking an object for data and acting on that data, we should instead tell an object what to do.", http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TellDontAsk.html
 
- Don't repeat yourself (DRY)
 
 "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.", http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DontRepeatYourself
