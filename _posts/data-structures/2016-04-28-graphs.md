## Definitions

__graph__ a data structure formed by a set of vertices and edges connecting those vertices.
__directed graph__ a graph whose edges have directions.
__path__ a sequence of vertices connected by edges. The length of a path is the number of its edges. 
__cycle__ a path which has at least one edge and whose first and last vertices are the same vertice.
__acyclic graph__ a graph without any cycle.
__connected graph__ a graph where there is a path between every pair of vertices in the graph
__tree__ an acyclic connected graph.
__spanning tree of a graph__ a tree with all the vertices of the graph
__forest__ a disjoint set of trees

## Representations

There are two common representations of a graph:

- Adjacency-list: Each vertex is associated with an array of its adjacent vertices. This can be implemented either by making a vertex manage its own array or the graph to manage the arrays of all vertices via a two dimensional array.
- Adjacency-matrix: The graph maintains a matrix where the entry `(u,v)` has positive value if vertices `u` and `v` are adjacent to each other.

The former representation is more flexible as it allows to include custom data to the vertices and edges, and is also more memory-efficient as memory is only preserved for existing edges. On the other hand, the latter is simpler to implement. It also facilitates the check if there is an edge between any two vertices. However, it always requires `O(V^2)` memory.

## Breadth-first search (BFS)

Breadth-first search is an algorithm which can be used to find all vertices _reachable_ from a given vertex `s`. 

The main idea of this algorithm is to visit all the vertices at the same distance from `s` before going further to the next distance. In other words, it visits all the vertices at distance `k` from `s` before visiting all the vertices at distance `k + 1`. Because of this characteristic, the path found by this algorithm between `s` and any other vertex is also the shortest one between them [1].

This algorithm takes `O(V + E)` time in the worst case.

## Depth-first search (DFS)

Like BFS, DFS can also be used to find all vertices reachable from a given vertex `s`. However, they are different in the order they visit the vertices. 

This algorithm always tries to visit the vertex which is the farthest from `s` and has not yet been visited before. At each distance `k` from `s`, the algorithm keeps discovering in the direction farther from `s` until no undiscovered vertex is found. It then vists the last discovered vertex, as it is the unvisited vertex farthest from `s`. After that, the algorithm backtracks to the vertex discovered prior to the just-visited one and repeats the whole discover-and-visit procedure. 

Like BFS, this algorithm takes `O(V + E)` time in the worst case.
