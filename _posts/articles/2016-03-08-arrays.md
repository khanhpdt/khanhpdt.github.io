## Arrays in general

An array is a fixed-size data structure where items can be accessed by their positions in the array.

An array is called _ragged_ or _jagged_ array if it is an array of arrays of different sizes.

The main advantage of using arrays is that they offer constant-time random access. This is because the memory is allocated for an array in such a way that the addresses of the array elements can be quickly computed [4]. On the other hand, the main disadvantage of using arrays is their fixed size. Once an array is created, its size cannot be changed.

| Operation | Performance |
| :-------------: | :-------------: |
| Insert       | `O(1)`      |
| Search       | `O(N)` |

## Arrays in Java

Arrays are first-class objects. An array object is only created in the heap when the array is initialized, not when it is declared. For example:

```java
// a variable is created, but the array is not yet created
int[] a;

// now an array object is actually created in the heap
a = new int[] {1, 2, 3, 4};

// shortcut to initialize arrays
int[b] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
```

The differences between arrays and other containers are [5]:

- Arrays offer a faster random access (as it is well-known for)
- But array size is fixed
- Arrays can contain either object references or primitive values, while containers can only hold object references.
- Containers offer more utilities to work on them.

It is a compile-time error if the component type of the array being initialized is not reifiable [6].

```java
// compile error
List<Integer>[] a = new List<Integer>[] {Arrays.asList(1), Arrays.asList(2)};

// a workaround to still guarantee type safe when using the array
List<Integer>[] a = (List<Integer>[]) new List[] {Arrays.asList(1), Arrays.asList(2)};
```

Arrays subject to _covariant_ subtyping, i.e., `S[]` is a subtype of `T[]` if `S` is a subtype of `T` [7]. This is in contrast to the _invariant_ subtyping used for the Java containers. Invariant subtyping means, for example, `List<S>` is not a subtype of `List<T>` even if `S` is a subtype of `T`.

Every array is associated with a `Class` object, and arrays with the same component type are associated with the same `Class` object [6].

```java
int[] a1 = new int[]{1, 2};
int[] b1 = new int[]{3, 4};
assert a1.getClass() == b1.getClass();

Integer[] a2 = new Integer[]{1, 2};
Integer[] b2 = new Integer[]{3, 4};
assert a2.getClass() == b2.getClass();
```
