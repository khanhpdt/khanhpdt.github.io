## Overview

A heap is a _nearly complete_ tree with a special property named _heap property_, which is about the relationship between a node and its children.

The heap property depends on the heap type. There are two types of heaps: max-heaps and min-heaps. In max-heaps, the property states that any node in the tree is equal to or larger than its children, and in min-heaps, it states that any node in the tree is equal to or smaller than its children.

## Binary heap

A binary heap is a heap satisfying binary tree properties, i.e., each node has at most two children.

A binary heap is typically implemented by an array. Because a binary heap is a nearly complete binary tree, given the position of a node in the array, its parent and children can be easily located. Specifically, if the node index is `i`, then the indexes of its parent, left and right child are `floor((i - 1)/2), 2*i + 1, 2*i + 2`, given that the node index starts at `0`.

It takes `O(n)` time to build a binary heap from an unorderred array, where `n` is the heap size [1].
