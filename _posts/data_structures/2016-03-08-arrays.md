# Arrays in general

An array is a fixed-size data structure used to store a collection of elements which are accessed by their indexes in the array.

- Pros
  - Fast random access, because the memory is allocated for an array such that the addresses of its elements can be quickly computed [4].
- Cons
  - Fixed size.

# Arrays in Java

Arrays are first-class objects.

```
// a variable is created, but the array is not yet created
int[] a;

// An array object is actually created in the heap. The array variable points to
// that object, which holds references to the array elements.
a = new int[] {1, 2, 3, 4};

// shortcut to initialize arrays
int[b] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
```

## Comparison with other containers

The differences between arrays and other containers are [5]:

- Arrays offer a faster random access (as it is well-known for)
- But array size is fixed
- Arrays can contain either object references or primitive values, while containers can only hold object references.
- Containers offer much more utilities to work on them.
